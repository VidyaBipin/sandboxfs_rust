# Installation instructions

Given that there have not yet been any formal releases of sandboxfs, there
currently are no prebuilt binaries available.  To use sandboxfs, you will
have to build and install it from a fresh checkout of the GitHub tree.

## From sources with Bazel

The preferred mechanism to build sandboxfs is to use the
[Bazel](http://bazel.build) build system.  The reason is that this provides
a reproducible build environment with pinned versions of all required
dependencies and also integrates well with various support tools used
during installation and during development.

To get started:

1.  [Download and install Bazel](https://bazel.build/).

1.  [Download and install Go](https://golang.org/).

    *   If you don't want to do this by hand and would rather have Bazel
        manage the installation of Go for you, edit the `WORKSPACE` file
        and remove the `go_version = "host"` parameter from the
        `go_register_toolchains` statement.

1.  Run `bazel build //admin/install` to download all required dependencies,
    build the final binary, and build the installation tool.

1.  To copy all binary and data files to the default destination of
    `/usr/local`, run `./bazel-bin/admin/install/install`.

    *   You will (most likely) need superuser permissions to install
        under `/usr/local`, so run the previous command with `sudo`.

    *   The reason the above command is not `sudo bazel run ...` is because
        running Bazel under `sudo` will cause a full rebuild of everything.
        Don't run Bazel as root.  Instead, just build the installation tool
        first and run it separately, as described above.

    *   If you want to install sandboxfs under a custom prefix, run
        `./bazel-bin/admin/install/install --prefix=/path/to/prefix`
        instead.

## From sources with the Go tools

You can also build sandboxfs from this Git repository using the standard Go
tools as follows:

    go get github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs/cmd/sandboxfs
    go build github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs/cmd/sandboxfs

This is not supported because this mechanism does not provide a way to
install the built product.  (Yes, `go install` does install the binary but does
not handle other support files such as documentation.)

Furthermore, this mechanism does not bundle build information into the final
binary, which means the final binary **cannot be shipped** and may not
interact well with other tools.
