# sandboxfs: A virtual file system for sandboxing

sandboxfs is a **FUSE file system** that exposes a combination of multiple
files and directories from the host's file system in the form of a virtual
tree with an arbitrary layout.  You can think of a sandbox as an arbitrary
**view into the host's file system** with different access privileges per
directory.

sandboxfs is **designed to allow running commands** with limited access to
the file system by using the virtual tree as their new root, and to do so
consistently across a variety of platforms.

sandboxfs is **licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE)** and is
not an official Google product.
